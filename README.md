## Overview

### Description

The Node.js Backend Core is a robust and scalable backend service developed in TypeScript. It provides essential backend functionalities such as authentication, API request handling, database management using Prisma ORM and more.

### Purpose

This backend service is designed to serve as a foundation for scalable web applications, managing authentication, session handling, data storage, and API endpoint management. It connects with a Postgress database and utilizes Redis for session caching and AWS S3 Bucket for file storage.

### Key Features

- API request handling with Express
- Database management with Prisma ORM
- Dockerized for easy deployment
- Configuration management using environment variables

## Key Directories

- config/: Contains configuration files for different environments (e.g., custom environment variables, default settings).
- prisma/: Used for database management with Prisma ORM, containing schema definitions and migrations.
- src/: The primary source code directory that includes all the core application logic, API routes, module-specific files, configuration, utilities, and schema definitions.
- module_name/: Represents individual modules/features of the application, containing their respective routes.ts, controllers.ts, and service.ts files.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- OS: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Node.js: v14 or higher
- NPM: v6 or higher
- Postgress Database
- Redis Server (for session handling)
- AWS S3 Bucket (for file handling)

### Dependencies

- Node.js packages and tools (e.g., Express, Prisma, Redis, etc.)
- Docker (if deploying in a containerized environment)

## Installation

### Step-by-Step Guide

## Contributing

### Contribution Guidelines (Using Git Flow)

We follow the Git Flow branching strategy. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

Main Branches:

- main: This branch contains the production-ready code. It should always be stable.
- develop: This branch contains the latest development changes. It is the default branch where features are merged.
- Supporting Branches:
- Feature Branches: For developing new features.
  - Naming convention: feature/feature-name
  - Branch off from develop and merge back into develop.
- Hotfix Branches: For quick fixes in production.
  - Naming convention: hotfix/hotfix-name
  - Branch off from main and merge back into both main and develop.
- Release Branches: For preparing the code for a production release. - Naming convention: release/version-number - Branch off from develop and merge into main once ready.
  Workflow:
- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch based on the type of work (feature/, hotfix/, or release/).
- Commit your changes to the new branch (git commit -m 'Add feature or fix').
- Push to your fork (git push origin feature/your-branch).
- Open a Pull Request (PR) to develop or main as appropriate.

### Code Review

Ensure your code is reviewed and approved before merging.
